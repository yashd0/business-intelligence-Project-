# Business-Intelligence-Project-(University-Admission-Prediction) 

In this Project, We have implemented various machine learning models that predict whether the probability of a student getting accepted into a University offering a Masters degree and we have build an attractive and eye-catching dashboard on Microsoft Power BI 


# Data

The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The parameters included are :

GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
University Rating ( out of 5 ) 
Statement of Purpose 
Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 ) 
Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 ) 
Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )


# Model 

For this dataset, we tried the following four models listed as below :

1} AdaBoost 
2} Naive Bayes 
3} Neural Network
4} Random Forest
5} Logistic Regression
